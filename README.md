### WWDC 22 Winner

## About the project
Clothes are part of us. We share moments and our history with them, as well as showing our personality, origins and who we are through them. This project is about how important they are to us and to the world, and about the need to give them a second chance to have other stories with other people when we no longer want to wear them. Besides resignifying, we contribute to take care of the planet and other people.

In this project, besides doing all the visual identity, collages and illustrations, its development in Swift language was a complex process, in which several different frameworks were used, such as **SpriteKit, SwiftUI, UIKit, CALayer, Core Motion, AVKit and others**. All of them were used in order to provide a more immersive experience and also to make the best use of the iPad.
